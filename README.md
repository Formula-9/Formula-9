### Hello there ! ðŸ‘‹

### Who am I ?

My username is Formula-9, and I am a former student of the Robert Gordon University of Aberdeen, in Scotland, and prior to graduating from it, I have also been studying at the 
Institut Universitaire de Technologie de Limoges (IUT Limoges). I am a computer science enthusiast, and someone who enjoys learning how they operate, whether at a low-level or 
at the higher levels. I also enjoy programming puzzles, as I find them fun to solve, and they are an excellent way to learn new tricks.

</p>

Computer Science and related subjects aside, I also do like reading science articles, or catching up with what are the latest innovations in a few science-related domains (space/astronomy, aeronautics, quantum physics).
